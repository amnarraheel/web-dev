            A chocolate brownie, or simply a brownie, is a chocolate baked confection. Brownies come in a variety of
            forms and may be either fudgy or cakey, depending on their density. Brownies often, but not always, have a
            glossy "skin" on their upper crust referred to as flint. They may also include nuts, frosting, chocolate
            chips, or other ingredients. A variation made with brown sugar and vanilla rather than chocolate in the
            batter is called a blond brownie or blondie. The brownie was developed in the United States at the end of
            the 19th century and popularized there during the first half of the 20th century.
            Brownies are typically eaten by hand, and may be accompanied by a glass of milk, served warm with ice cream
            topped with whipped cream, or sprinkled with powdered sugar and fudge. In North America, they
            are common homemade treats and they are also popular in restaurants, ice cream parlors, and coffeehouses.

            A dark chocolate mocha also called mocaccino is a
            chocolate-flavoured warm beverage that is a variant of a caff√® latte 
            commonly served in a glass rather than a mug. Other commonly used spellings are mochaccino and also
            mochachino. The name is derived from the city of Mokha, Yemen, which was one of the centres of early coffee
            trade.Like latte, the name is commonly shortened to just mocha.
